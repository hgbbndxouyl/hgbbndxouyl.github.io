            MCAST Mission Statement
 “To provide universally accessible vocational and professional education and training with an international dimension, responsive to the needs of the individual and the economy.”

Established in 2001, the Malta College of Arts, Science and Technology is the country’s leading vocational education and training institution.  Six Institutes in Malta and the Gozo Campus, MCAST offers over 190 full-time courses and over 300 part-time vocational courses ranging from certificates to Doctoral level (MQF Level 1 to Level 8).
The six MCAST  Institutes namely the Institute of Applied Sciences, the Institute for the Creative Arts, the Institute of Engineering and Transport, the Institute of Business Management and Commerce, the Institute of Community Services, the Institute of Information and Communication Technology and the Gozo Campus provide all the technical and professional expertise towards the delivery of the programmes at MCAST. They also maintain the aim of driving forward all the areas of study under their respective responsibility. This corporate structure enables focused strategies, which address the specific needs of students at each level while maintaining a healthy dialogue with all interested stakeholders in order to provide the best programmes for the needs of the local economy and society.

MCAST’s relationship with industry stimulates the College’s success – its programmes are flexible, relevant and responsive to the aspirations of the students and to the needs of industries which are constantly evolving to meet the challenges of a changing global economy. The College supports small and medium-sized enterprises through a multidisciplinary approach. This encompasses work-based learning through the Apprenticeships Programme, the various entrepreneurship initiatives and through MG2i (MCAST’s commercial arm) services whereby it provides training courses tailor-made to their needs. The College is focusing on increasing the portfolio of MG2i by developing new programmes in Life Long Learning, accrediting new programmes at different levels, including Master’s degrees, and introducing more professional development programmes. It is working on the internationalisation of MG2i through the Training and Professional Development Programmes and joint-venture opportunities in different vocational areas.
